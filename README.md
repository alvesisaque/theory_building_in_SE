**Title: Continuous Theory Building in Software Engineering**

**Abstract:**
Software Engineering (SE) often adapts theory-building frameworks from the social sciences to address socio-technical complexity. The core phases of this process—conceptual development, operationalization, testing, and application—require systematic procedures. This research aims to provide and demonstrate such procedures by applying a new method to harmonize and refine existing DevOps team taxonomy theories. We collaborated with scholars and executed this method in four steps. First, we harmonized DevOps team structure theories derived from 11 secondary data sources. This was followed by operationalization, which yielded 10 constructs, 28 propositions, and 83 hypotheses. Finally, we formalize a systematic process for creating and evolving SE theories, based on the framework provided by Sjoberg et al. This method offers a valuable resource for researchers drafting SE theories and assists practitioners in understanding and addressing issues related to the DevOps phenomenon.

**Data Availability:**

We organized the artifacts in this repository according to the three major phases of this research:
- **conceptual_development:** This folder contains all artifacts related to the initial conceptual development of the research.
- **operationalization:** This folder houses all artifacts generated during the hypothesis creation phase.
- **testing_refinement:** This folder includes all artifacts and interview transcripts used during the three rounds of theory testing and refinement.
